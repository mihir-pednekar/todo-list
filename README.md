# Project: Online TODO List

Build a simple online TODO list with a web interface that can be used in all popular web browsers. The application has to Support multiple users, store necessary data in a in-memory database and be built with J2EE technology (use of open-source frameworks is also allowed).

## Minimal functionality

 User can sign in using unique login and password securely (this can be hard coded to a default user list, at list one user e.g. with username: test, password: pwd123)
 User can view her/his task list
 User can add/remove task
 All changes can be persistent to allow view them in next sign in by the same user
 Each task should display the date of last updates and description
 User can check/uncheck any task on their list
 Consider performance
